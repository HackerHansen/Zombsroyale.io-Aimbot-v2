# Zombsroyale.io-Aimbot-v2
This is a zombsroyale.io aimbot written completely in autohotkey. 
It is still in beta, so some features are not yet present. Aimbot works best at close range; it becomes less effective at long range against moving targets unless player prediction is enabled. This aimbot is not recommended for RPGs or snipers. 

This aimbot is also pretty bad, it was mainly just an experimental program I made a while ago lol

###### INSTRUCTIONS: 
Download aimbot.zip 

Extract the files 

Run the executable 

Read the instructions 

Start zombsroyale.io (preferrably the client) 

Join a match 

Hold down LShift to auto-lock the mouse onto nearly every player(NoSkins are always detected, many others are also detected. Some skins will not be recognized as players)

IF IT DOESN'T WORK, SET A NEW TARGET. 

Make sure not to use this in areas of the map where there are lighting changes(while in the gas or in Haunted Hallows) 

This works best at close range. Inertia prediction is implemented but not complete. It's a bit buggy at the moment.
